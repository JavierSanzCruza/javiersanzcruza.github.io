  abstract: "The use of recommender systems to assist in the provision of financial asset and portfolio recommendations to investors is increasing, spanning a wide range of algorithms and techniques. Several strategies have been devised for the evaluation of financial asset recommendations, with the two most prominent strategies measuring (a) the money customers could obtain if they followed the recommendations (profitability-based evaluation) and (b) the ability of models to predict future customer investments (transaction-based evaluation). If customers are effective investors, we would expect these two perspectives to be positively correlated. In this paper, we perform experiments over a new large-scale financial recommendation dataset with real customer investment transactions to validate this assumption. Surprisingly, we find that transaction and profitability-based metrics are in fact negatively correlated and moreover, algorithms that actively try to learn from past customer transactions lose money over the mid-term. A thorough analysis of model performance and customer transaction patterns over time illustrates that this is due to a set of confounding factors, namely: customers failing to beat the market with their investments; a tendency for the customers to favour different investment lengths; and the impact of global events such as the Covid-19 pandemic."

  abstract: Link prediction has mainly been addressed as an accuracy-targeting problem in social network analysis. We discuss different perspectives on the problem considering other dimensions and effects that the link prediction methods may have on the network where they are applied. Specifically, we consider the structural effects the methods can have if the predicted links are added to the network. We consider further utility dimensions beyond prediction accuracy, namely novelty and diversity. We adapt specific metrics from social network analysis, recommender systems and information retrieval, and we empirically observe the effect of a set of link prediction algorithms over Twitter data.
