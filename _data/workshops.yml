  abstract: "Financial asset recommender (FAR) systems suggest investment assets to customers based on past market information. Many of these models choose those securities which they estimate to be more profitable for customers. Financial knowledge graphs (KGs) -- data structures containing information about assets and their relations to other involved entities (companies, people) -- have been one of the data sources exploited to drive asset selection. Although the construction of knowledge graphs from different sources (news, reports) has previously been investigated, there has been limited analysis of the effect these construction strategies have for FAR. In this work, we compare two different knowledge graphs representing U.S. stocks under a unified FAR framework: a knowledge graph crawled from a general knowledge base, Wikidata, and a knowledge graph built by extracting entities and relations from 10K financial reports using the GoLLIE open information extraction model. We show that integrating these KGs in FAR can lead up to 10.7% improvements in monthly ROI. However, the nature of these graphs makes algorithms prone to bias the recommendations towards different asset types. Therefore, we further propose and evaluate an adaptive graph selection strategy, which dynamically chooses the suitable graph prediction model—trained on either the 10K Graph or the Wikidata Graph—for each asset. The findings indicate that stock-level and sector-level selection strategies respond differently to the length of the recency window, reflecting, respectively, a preference for short-term responsiveness and long-term stability."

  abstract: "Biomedical entity linking models disambiguate mentions in text by matching them with unique biomedical concepts. This problem is commonly addressed using a two-stage pipeline comprising an inexpensive candidate generator, which filters a subset of suitable entities for a mention, and a costly but precise reranker that provides the final matching between the mention and the concept. With the goal of applying two-stage entity linking at scale, we explore the construction of effective cross-encoder reranker models, capable of scoring multiple mention-entity pairs simultaneously. Through experiments on four entity linking datasets, we show that our cross-encoder models provide between 2.7 to 36.97 times faster training speeds and 3.8 to 26.47 times faster inference speeds than a base cross-encoder model capable of scoring only one entity, while achieving similar accuracy (differences between -3.42% to 2.76% Acc@1)."

  abstract: "In complex financial markets, recommender systems can play a crucial role in empowering individuals to make informed decisions. Existing studies predominantly focus on price prediction, but even the most sophisticated models cannot accurately predict stock prices. Also, many studies show that most individual investors do not follow established investment theories because they have their own preferences. Hence, the tricky point in stock recommendation is that recommendations should give good investment performance but also should not ignore individual preferences. To develop effective stock recommender systems, it is essential to consider three key aspects: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) temporal aspect of both stock features and individual preferences. In response, we develop the temporal graph network approach with mean-variance efficient learning PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing learning. As a result, our model demonstrated superior performance compared to various baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models, in a sense that our model exhibited good investment performance while maintaining competitive in capturing individual preferences."

  abstract: "Financial asset recommendation (FAR) is a sub-domain of recommender systems which identifies useful financial securities for investors, with the expectation that they will invest capital on the recommended assets. FAR solutions analyse and learn from multiple data sources, including time series pricing data, customer profile information and expectations, as well as past investments. However, most models have been developed over proprietary datasets, making a comparison over a common benchmark impossible. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing FAR-Trans, the first public dataset for FAR, containing pricing information and retail investor transactions acquired from a large European financial institution. We also provide a bench-marking comparison between eleven FAR algorithms over the data for use as future baselines"

  abstract: "The use of recommender systems to assist in the provision of financial asset and portfolio recommendations to investors is increasing, spanning a wide range of algorithms and techniques. Several strategies have been devised for the evaluation of financial asset recommendations, with the two most prominent strategies measuring (a) the money customers could obtain if they followed the recommendations (profitability-based evaluation) and (b) the ability of models to predict future customer investments (transaction-based evaluation). If customers are effective investors, we would expect these two perspectives to be positively correlated. In this paper, we perform experiments over a new large-scale financial recommendation dataset with real customer investment transactions to validate this assumption. Surprisingly, we find that transaction and profitability-based metrics are in fact negatively correlated and moreover, algorithms that actively try to learn from past customer transactions lose money over the mid-term. A thorough analysis of model performance and customer transaction patterns over time illustrates that this is due to a set of confounding factors, namely: customers failing to beat the market with their investments; a tendency for the customers to favour different investment lengths; and the impact of global events such as the Covid-19 pandemic."

  abstract: Link prediction has mainly been addressed as an accuracy-targeting problem in social network analysis. We discuss different perspectives on the problem considering other dimensions and effects that the link prediction methods may have on the network where they are applied. Specifically, we consider the structural effects the methods can have if the predicted links are added to the network. We consider further utility dimensions beyond prediction accuracy, namely novelty and diversity. We adapt specific metrics from social network analysis, recommender systems and information retrieval, and we empirically observe the effect of a set of link prediction algorithms over Twitter data.
