  description: "Graph representing the connections between characters in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, titled 'Obel's Garden'. This campaign has been running weekly since January 2024 -- with 23 game sessions so far. This is an example of a directed graph where links express different connections. Multiple connections can exist between two different characters. The represented network aims to represent temporality (as both nodes and edges have associated timestamps). Future updates of the representation shall show the continuous evolution of the network. This graph is constantly updated as new game sessions occur."

  description: "Graph representing the financial machine learning community. Nodes in this graph represent researchers and practitioners in the area who have organized workshops in this space, while two nodes are connected (with an undirected edge) if they have organized the same workshop. The main representation shows a map of the Earth (in black) over which we show the different workshop organizers. Every workshop series is assigned a different color, and node color represents average color of the workshops organized by each person. Alternative representations show the graph in a clustered format."
