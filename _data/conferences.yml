  abstract: "Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domainexpertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice."

  abstract: Neighborhood-based approaches remain widely used techniques in collaborative filtering recommender systems due to their versatility, simplicity, and efficiency. Traditionally, these algorithms consider similarity functions to measure how close user or item interactions are. However, their focus on capturing similar tastes often overlooks divergent preferences that could enhance recommendations. In this paper, we explore alternative methods to incorporate such information to improve beyond-accuracy performance in this type of recommenders. We define three mechanisms based on various modeling assumptions to integrate differing preferences into traditional nearest neighbors algorithms. Our comparison on four well-known and different datasets shows that our proposed approach can enhance the novelty and diversity of the recommendations while maintaining ranking accuracy.

    Conversational financial assistance is gaining increasing attention as a subdomain within the broader field of conversational AI, attracting interest from both the AI and finance communities.
    The application of conversational agents in finances is a particularly challenging subfield to explore, as financial scenarios require personalization and emotional support, especially during periods of market turmoil.
    In this paper, we present FinPersona, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven conversational agent for personalized financial advising. FinPersona enables a non-expert user to explore investment options through conversation and dialogue driven by knowledge of the individual user and their circumstances. Through FinPersona, we aim to illustrate the salient features of a working prototype, we well as raise awareness of the many challenges unique to the financial domain.

    Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender (PfoTGNRec), which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment.

    Financial asset recommendation (FAR) is an emerging sub-domain of the wider recommendation field that is concerned with recommending suitable financial assets to customers, with the expectation that those customers will invest capital into a subset of those assets. FAR is a particularly interesting sub-domain to explore, as unlike traditional movie or product recommendation, FAR solutions need to analyse and learn from a combination of time-series pricing data, company fundamentals, social signals and world events, relating the patterns observed to multi-faceted customer representations comprising profiling information, expectations and past investments. In this demo we will present a modular FAR platform; referred to as FAR-AI, with the goal of raising awareness and building a community around this emerging domain, as well as illustrate the challenges, design considerations and new research directions that FAR offers. The demo will comprise two components: 1) we will present the architecture of FAR-AI to attendees, to enable them to understand the how’s and the why’s of developing a FAR system; and 2) a live demonstration of FAR-AI as a customer-facing product, highlighting the differences in functionality between FAR solutions and traditional recommendation scenarios. The demo is supplemented by online-tutorial materials, to enable attendees new to this space to get practical experience with training FAR models.

    Link recommendation is an important and compelling problem at the intersection of recommender systems and online social networks. Given a user, link recommenders identify people in the platform the user might be interested in interacting with. We present RELISON, an extensible framework for running link recommendation experiments. The library provides a wide range of algorithms, along with tools for evaluating the produced recommendations. RELISON includes algorithms and metrics that consider the potential effect of recommendations on the properties of online social networks. For this reason, the library also implements network structure analysis metrics, community detection algorithms, and network diffusion simulation functionalities. The library code and documentation is available at https://github.com/ir-uam/RELISON.

    Contact recommendation is an important functionality in many social network scenarios including Twitter and Facebook, since they can help grow the social networks of users by suggesting, to a given user, people they might wish to follow. Recently, it has been shown that classical information retrieval (IR) weighting models – such as BM25 – can be adapted to effectively recommend new social contacts to a given user. However, the exact properties that make such adapted contact recommendation models effective at the task are as yet unknown. In this paper, inspired by new advances in the axiomatic theory of IR, we study the existing IR axioms for the contact recommendation task. Our theoretical analysis and empirical findings show that while the classical axioms related to term frequencies and term discrimination seem to havea positive impact on the recommendation effectiveness, those related to length normalization tend to be not desirable for the task.

    Contact recommendation has become a common functionality in online social platforms, and an established research topic in the social networks and recommender systems fields. Predicting and recommending links has been mainly addressed to date as an accuracy-targeting problem. In this paper we put forward a different perspective, considering that correctly predicted links may not be all equally valuable. Contact recommendation brings an opportunity to drive the structural evolution of a social network towards desirable properties of the network as a whole, beyond the sum of the isolated gains for the individual users to whom recommendations are delivered - global properties that we may want to assess and promote as explicit recommendation targets.
    In this perspective, we research the definition of relevant diversity metrics drawing from social network analysis concepts, and linking to prior diversity notions in recommender systems. In particular, we elaborate on the notion of weak tie recommendation as a means to enhance the structural diversity of networks. In order to show the signification of the proposed metrics, we report experiments with Twitter data illustrating how state of the art contact recommendation methods compare in terms of our metrics; we examine the tradeoff with accuracy, and we show that diverse link recommendations result in a corresponding diversity enhancement in the flow of information through the network, with potential implications in mitigating filter bubbles.

  abstract: The fast growth and development of online social networks has posed new challenges for information retrieval and, as a particular case, recommender systems. A particularly compelling problem in this context is recommending network edges, that is, automatically predicting people that a given user may wish or benefit from connecting to in the network. This task has interesting particularities compared to more traditional recommendation domains, a salient one being that recommended items belong to the same space as the users they are recommended to. In this paper, we investigate the connection between the contact recommendation and the text retrieval tasks. Specifically, we research the adaptation of IR models for recommending contacts in social networks. We report experiments over data downloaded from Twitter where we observe that IR models, particularly BM25, are competitive compared to state-of-the art contact recommendation methods. We further find that IR models have additional advantages in computational efficiency, and allow for fast incremental updates of recommendations as the network grows.
